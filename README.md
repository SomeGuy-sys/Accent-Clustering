# Accent-Clustering-Project

Using unsupervised **machine learning algorithms** to cluster english speaking accents.

In this project I was in charge of implementing a Guassian Hidden Markov Model.<br> 
**Hidden Markov Models** are probabistic mathematical models that can predict unobserve states using observeable states. For example we can determine what is the weather outside depending on seeing what people where when they head outside
