# Accent-Clustering-Project

I was in a group project with my peers using unsupervised **machine learning algorithms** to cluster english speaking accents that were from america.<br>

This repo has 2 files: the python note book that goes in to the nitty gritty of the data and parsing of the data. The other file is the final report in PDF format.<br>

In this project I was in charge of implementing a Guassian Hidden Markov Model (GHMM).<br> 
**Hidden Markov Models** are probabistic mathematical models that can predict unobserve states using observeable states. For example we can determine what is the weather outside depending on seeing what people where when they head outside.

I did this by using the data that parsed by my groupmates (they have also implemented a different clustering algorthim to compare) used a python lilbary to build my GHMM. 

We compared the results and both algorthims ended up inconclusive, but it was a unquie learning experience on in impleneting a data parser from voice recording and using a machine learning model on the parse data. Overall the group project recived a letter A grade.
